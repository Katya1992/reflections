What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit,
 like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

The goos thing is that you may betterknow what you need or want to commint and why in this period of time instead of another. 
Bad side of manual commiting is that you can just forget to commit or make some mistacke commit.


Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, 
while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
Because different files are connected in one thing.


How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
By using git log I can see the history of all changes in file. By using git diff I 
can compare wich exactly changes were made in commits that are interesting me.


How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
You always can find previouse to some mistakes change ant compare this versions and see what changes of code called to some mistakes.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
